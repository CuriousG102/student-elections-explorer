-----------------Navigation Page: The JSON-----------------

By way of explanation: This provides a full example of the structure of the json file that will power the student elections explorer. I can't give you the actual file yet because I have to write the code to make it :p. If something is an array it is because it can hold multiple instances of whatever example I've put in there. If something is in {{THESE}} it is because it is a vari

stored on the path "data/navigation.json"

-----------------Candidate Page-----------------

The candidate page is a bit more complex. I am using our templating system (Flask) to build static html files for all the 
candidates. You can use any of the variables I list here by typing {{variable_name_here}}. Don't worry about how it works
if you don't want to. If you do want to know check out the source code and read some Flask documentation as well as documentation
on copytext, then check the repository in which I've hacked on copytext a bit

{{headshot_photo_url|safe}} e.g. /images/...
{{headshot_photo_credit}} e.g. Barack Obama
{{candidate_name}} e.g. John Jacob
{{major}} e.g. Computer Science
{{year}} e.g. Junior
{{json|safe}}

The json variable inserts a JSON object literal that looks like the following. Some variables may or may not be present so I have the text that will be present if the variable wasn't filled out by our staff on one side of a slash mark and filler text on the other side
