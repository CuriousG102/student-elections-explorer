This past year, I’ve worked on numerous issues ranging from student input regarding the West Campus sound ordinance to more Monday-Wednesday classes to keeping the FAC open 24/7. Although my term is nearing the end, I still have not accomplished all the goals I’ve sought. Another year of being a Liberal Arts Representative will allow me to pursue more issues and provide you all with an experienced voice in the assembly. I will continue to focus on improving student engagement, voicing concerns of students to Austin City Hall, the Texas State Legislature and the U.S. Congress, and adequately represent the opinion of Liberal Arts students.","DT Coverage":[{"link":"","title":""}]}
