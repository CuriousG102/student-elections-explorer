My name is Lauren Gusman and I am a Vocal Performance major in the Butler School of Music. I am running to be your Fine Arts Representative for the upcoming school year. Although I am a first year, I have found my though some wonderful leadership programs such as the University Leadership Network, Gateway Scholars, The Multicultural Leadership Institute, Phi Beta Chi (A Professional Women’s Business Organization), and I am the Vice President of Music in the Fine Arts Council. Through these programs, I have learned to strive for excellence, exemplify team building, and gain character. I have noticed as I have been here, as far as the Fine Arts college goes, we have fallen behind. We’ve lost some of our best programs from all three of our departments. University wide, this was a loss. While I can’t say I can bring those back, I do plan on having a come back. Given this, it’s time we come together as a college to work together to overcome our losses. As the Student Government Fine Arts Representative, my visions for us is to communicate. Through our commeradery and our basic need of creativity, I plan on building more programs and clubs inside our college based on what our fine arts student body wants as a whole. From academics to performances to art galleries, I care about our image. I don’t just want to be the voice for all of us, I want to be the voice y’all choose to represent who we are and what we can do.
