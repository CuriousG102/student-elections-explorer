Having attended UT since 2010 and graduating last year with a B.A. in Plan II Honors, Government Honors, History, and Asian Studies, I have more experience on campus than nearly all the other candidates. In addition, I have previous experience in SG as the Director of Students with Disabilities Agency from 2011-2012 and serving on the Parking & Traffic Appeals Committee from 2013-2014. As SG Rep, I would be representing a population of UT students that haven’t been represented in SG in the last few years and will work towards increasing law students’ involvement with the rest of the campus. In this capacity, I will also be able to address any concerns law students may have through passing resolutions and working with the different university administrations.","DT Coverage":[{"link":"","title":""}]}
