As the social chair for the Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity, I’ve learned some things. First, THE University of Texas has an astonishing amount of great people with different beliefs and ideas that should be embraced. Second, simply how to have fun. Though we all know that the most important reason to go to college is to get an education, that doesn’t mean college shouldn’t be fun. Though our Student Government has done great work for our university, do you feel that they are representative of you? You may see me in Professor Bonevac’s class or at Gregory, but you can also catch me at Blind Pig or at Roundup. Government should represent you, plain and simple. I believe that I am for the people and soon to be by the people.","DT Coverage":[{"link":"","title":""}]}
