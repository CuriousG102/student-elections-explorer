Generally, if engineers have a problem, I think itâ€™s safe to say we just hunker down and push through it, willing to persist through the challenge, be it large or small. That being said, I do have a few ideas involving implementation of better systems to make students more aware of help and resources which often fly under the radar; primarily, however, my goal is to have as tight of a feedback loop with students as possible, bringing their ideas to the table, and even if solutions to them are not possible through means which I have access to, at least bringing plausible issues to light.","DT Coverage":[{"link":"","title":""}]}
